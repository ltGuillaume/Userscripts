If you want to use random service instances from a curated list, you can set the instance URL to `farside.link/_/<service>`, e.g. `farside.link/_/bibliogram`. If you experience problems with the loaded instance, just press back in your browser and another instance will be used.

You can also set up your own instance of [Farside](https://github.com/benbusby/farside) by Ben Busby.
